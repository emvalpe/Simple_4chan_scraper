# Simple_4chan_scraper
I wrote something to scrape info from 4chan with certain key words to avoid the uhh, rest of 4chan

Add your key words to the "words_of_interest" list in start.py

Things to add: 
 - img processing/compression: https://github.com/4chan/4chan-API/blob/master/pages/User_images_and_static_content.md
 - profile linking maybe
 - post frequency analysis (or I will just find a good website)
